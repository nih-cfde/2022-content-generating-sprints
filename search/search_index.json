Sprints will be in July and August, and are part of the larger effort to expand and showcase CFDE capabilities in preparation for the September demo to the Council of Councils. Who should participate? Do you have information on genes, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases that don't fit within the current Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2)? If so, we want you to come to this sprint so that we can work together to add this information to the portal! Scheduling We hope you will participate! Please fill out any blackout dates and provide your preliminary ideas here: https://forms.gle/zppvKfF5NQPXj4sr9 We will do our best to accommodate schedule requests! CFDE Portal Annotations The CFDE Portal can now support annotating controlled vocabulary pages with additional information. These annotations enrich existing pages by linking to external pages and metadata or interactive modules. These sprints will focus on generating annotations for gene , anatomy , compound , and disease pages. See examples of annotated Gene and Anatomy pages under the \u201cResources\u201d category: https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/record/#1/CFDE:anatomy/nid=253 https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/record/#1/CFDE:gene/nid=1 Annotations must be written in a custom Markdown text format, and submitted to the CFDE-CC through a simple GitHub-based process. Importantly, annotations can be updated between portal data releases, on a semi-monthly schedule. We at the CFDE-CC will provide technical support while groups brainstorm and work together on building annotation-generating workflows throughout this sprint. Event Details Both sprints will last 5 days and be largely asynchronous , besides an introductory session to cover technical infrastructure and support. Several sessions will be run to help accommodate schedule conflicts. Throughout the week, co-working sessions over zoom with breakout rooms will be available where we can resolve problems and share solutions. A closing session will recap what work was accomplished, and goals for the next sprint.

We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody. The CFDE is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of Consortium members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any venue, including meetings, presentations, or discussions. The Less Quick Version Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact our Code of Conduct Team immediately. If you would prefer to remain anonymous, you can email that address using a free single-anonymous email service like Anonymouse We expect participants to follow these guidelines at any CFDE event.
