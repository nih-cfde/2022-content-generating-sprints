# Internal Content Generation Sprints

The CFDE-CC will host two content generation sprints for DCCs and R03 recipients to produce annotations for CFDE Portal gene, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases pages. The first sprint will be from June 27 - July 1 and the second will be in July or August. These are part of the larger effort to expand and showcase CFDE capabilities in preparation for the September demo to the Council of Councils.

## Who should participate?

Do you have information on genes, anatomy terms, compounds, and diseases that don't fit within the current C2M2? If so, we want you to come to this sprint so that we can work together to add this information to the portal!

## Scheduling

We hope you will participate! Please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/zppvKfF5NQPXj4sr9) to indicated your interest, and add any blackout dates that do not work for you or your team. We will do our best to accommodate schedule requests!

## CFDE Portal Annotations

The CFDE Portal can now support annotating controlled vocabulary pages with additional information. These annotations enrich existing pages by linking to external pages and metadata or interactive modules.

See examples of annotated [Gene](https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/record/#1/CFDE:gene/nid=1) and [Anatomy](https://app.nih-cfde.org/chaise/record/#1/CFDE:anatomy/nid=253) pages under the “Resources” category.

We at the CFDE-CC will provide technical support while groups brainstorm and work together on building annotation-generating workflows throughout this sprint. Annotations must be written in a custom Markdown text format, and submitted to the CFDE-CC through a simple GitHub-based process. Importantly, annotations can be updated between portal data releases, on a semi-monthly schedule.

## Event Details

Both sprints will last 5 days and be largely asynchronous, besides an introductory session to cover technical infrastructure and support. Several sessions will be run to help accommodate schedule conflicts. Throughout the week, co-working sessions over zoom with breakout rooms will be available where we can resolve problems and share solutions. A closing session will recap what work was accomplished, and goals for the next sprint.
